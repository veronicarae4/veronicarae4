- 👋 Hi, I’m @veronicarae4
- 👀 I’m interested in fair, equitable, and accessible use of big data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what there is to know and making a (huge) list of what I don't know
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning - particularly study buddy accountability at beginner level. Particularly keen to join forces with any LGBTQI+ / women / non-binary folks
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter @VeronicaRaeDS
